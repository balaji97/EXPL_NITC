                        <h2>Class Definitions</h2>
                        <p>
                            Classes extend the notion of ExpL types.  A class <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)" target="_blank">encapsulates </a> <b><i>member fields</i></b> and <b><i>member functions</i></b> (called <b>methods</b> in OOP jargon).  The following is an example for a class definition. Standard syntax and semantics conventions followed in languages like Java and C++ are assumed.
                        </p>



                      <script src="js/a5a21ac08e12e3a57e8a7136100e0a50.js"></script>


                        <p>
                            All the class definitions in a program must be placed together, between the keywords <i>class</i> and <i>endclass</i>.   Declaration of class variables follow exactly the same syntax as declaration of user defined type variables in ExpL. <b>The member fields of a class must be declared before member functions are declared.</b>   Class definitions must be placed after type definitions, but before global declarations.  (Further example programs are provided at the end).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                             Since OExpL is designed for  pedegogical purposes, the following restrictions are imposed to simplify implementation.

                         <ol type="a">
                            <li>
                                <b>The member fields of a class may be of type integer, string, user defined types, previously defined classes or of the same class.</b> Thus the language supports   both<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance" target="_blank"><i> Composition and Inheritance.</i></a>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <b>Member fields of a class are private to the class</b> in the sense that they can be accessed only by the methods defined in the class.  The language does not permit <i>access modifiers</i> like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_modifiers" target="_blank"><b>public</b> or <b>protected</b>.</a>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Class variables can be declared only globally.  Class variables cannot be arguments to functions; a function cannot have a class as its return type</b> and class variables cannot occur as local variables within functions.
                                <!--(Exercises in the <a href="http://silcnitc.github.io/roadmap.html" target="_blank">roadmap</a> extends the language by dropping some of these restrictions).-->
                            </li>

                            <li> All the member fields and methods should be declared between <i>decl</i> and <i>enddecl</i>. </li>

                           <li>
                                In methods defined within a class, the special keyword <b>self</b> refers to the instance of the class through which the method was invoked.  ( The  usage is similar in spirit  to  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_(computer_programming)" target="_blank"><b>this</b> in C++.</a> )
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The methods defined in a class may have parameters as well as local variables.  The syntax and semantics rules are similar to other ExpL functions.
                                 However, there are some important differences:
                         	<p>

                                a) <b>Methods</b> of a class, apart from its arguments and local variables,<b> have access only to the member fields of the corresponding class.</b>
                            	<br>


                                b) <b>A method can invoke only functions of the same class or functions inherited from its parent class or methods of class variables occuring as member fields of the class. </b> <!-- However, <b> recursive calls to the same function are permitted.</b>-->



                                 (Be aware of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_base_class" target="_blank"> <i>fragile base class problem</i></a>).

                        <p>
                            The language supports class<b> extension</b>.  A class defined by extension of another class is called a <i>derived class</i> (or <i>child class</i>) of the <i>parent class</i> (sometimes called the <i>base class</i>). The following example demonstrates the syntax of class extension.  The language does not support<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance" target="_blank"> multiple inheritance </a> .
                        </p>


                    <script src="js/6a973317f3e10937b42981b2147be063.js"></script>

                        <p>
                            The semantics of class extension can be summarized as follows:
                         <ol>
                            <li>
                            <b>The derived class inherits all member fields of the parent class automatically. </b> If additional fields are defined, they will be specific to the derived class. <b>The derived class cannot re-declare a member field already declared in the parent class.</b>

                            </li>

                            <li>
                            <b>The derived class inherits only those methods of the parent class which are not re-defined (overridden).</b>  If a method is overridden, the new definition will be the only valid definition for the derived class. All the overridden methods must be declared again in the derived class. <b>The signature of the overridden method must match exactly in both number and types of arguments with the signature of the function in the parent class.
                            </b>  Only one function of the same name is permitted in a class.  Thus, the language does <b>not</b> permit <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading" target="_blank">function overloading</a>.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        </p>

                        <h2>Class variables and Instantiation</h2>
                        <p>
                            Class variables are declared just like other variables in the global declaration section after type definitions and class definitions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Example:

                          <script src="js/406d14fb431de1b8d5cb3fb517a3c271.js"></script>
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            Object instance is created for a variable of a class with the built-in function <i>new</i>.  The language does not support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructor_(object-oriented_programming" target="_blank">constructors  and destructors</a>.  Hence intitialization of objects has to be done explicitly.  An object can be deallocated using the built-in function <i>delete</i>.  The function <i>new</i> will create an object of a specified class at run time, and assigns a <i>reference</i> to the object into a variable.  A variable of a given class may be assigned a reference to an object of any desendent class using <i>new</i>.  Access semantics of class variables is similar to  ExpL user-defined-types,  except for the details associated with methods defined within classes.  These details are described below.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Subtype Polymorphism</h2>
                        <p>
                        <b>A variable of a parent class can refer to any object in its inheritance hierarchy.</b>  That is, if class B extends class A and class C extends class B, then a variable of class A can refer to objects of classes A, B or C, whereas a variable of class B can refer to any object of class B or C.  (References are set using the ExpL <i>assignment statement</i> in the normal way, as with user defined types. The  function <i><b> new </b></i>  can also be used to set the reference for a variable).   When a method is invoked with a variable of class B or C,  if the method is inherited from an ancestor class, the ancestor's method is invoked.   This is illustrated by the following examples.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                         <h2> Run time Binding</h2>

                         <p>
                            Suppose that a variable declared to be of a parent class in an inheritance hierarchy holds the reference to an instance of a derived class.  On invocation of a method of the parent class variable, if the method is over-ridden by the derived class, the method of the derived class is invoked.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                            This pivotal feature of object oriented programming compilcates the compiler implementation because<b> at the time of  generating code for a method invocation, the correct method to call may not be known,</b> as illustrated in the example below.
                          </p>

                        <p>
                             In the above code, the value of the variable n read from the input at run-time determines whether the variable <i>arbitrary</i> refers to an object of the class - person or the class - student.   Consequently, at compile time, we cannot decide whether the call <i>arbitrary.printDetails()</i> must be translated to an invocation of the function in the parent class or the child class.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To resolve such function invocations, the method of  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_binding" target="_blank">dynamic binding</a> must be implemented using the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table" target="_blank">The virtual function table method</a> .A tutorial explaining the implementation of virtual function tables is given <a href="oexpl-run-data-structures.html" target="_blank"> here </a>.
